Classify each document into EXACTLY ONE of these types:
- "Service Book" — government employee service history records (joining date, postings, transfers)
- "PPO" — Pension Payment Order (pension amount, effective date, pensioner details)
- "Audit Memo" — CAG audit findings, observations, memo numbers
- "Payroll Statement" — monthly salary breakdown with basic pay, allowances, deductions
- "Other" — anything else (correspondence, certificates, miscellaneous)

You will receive either extracted text or a description of the document content.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{"documentType": "<one of the 5 types>", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}

Do not include any other text. Do not include markdown code fences.`,
